# Lisbon_Hotel_Revenue
Forecast of hotel industry revenue in the city of Lisbon, Portugal. 


This project was a forecating project which came with its own set of problems mainly the impact of the covid pandemic in forecasting. 

One way we circumvented this was the use of Meta's Prophet algorithm which allowed us assign holidays to covid lockdowns. This was good because the model took less weight in holidays when building teh forecast and making predictions.
